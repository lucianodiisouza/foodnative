### Can i run it?
The fake-backend used here, come from `tw-dev-server` library, be sure to have it installed using `npm i -g tw-dev-server` and typing `tw-dev-server` command at separated terminal window. <br />
After clone the project to your local machine, be sure that you have all dependencies necessary tiping `yarn` at project root to install yarn dependencies and `pod install` at ios folder (if you are in a MacOS machine) <br />
run project using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` (MacOS machine only).

To add products to api and show it on mobile, you need to use de tw-dev-server GUI, located at https://treinaweb.github.io/tw-dev-server/ an post to `api/foodnative/products` will insert the product, use the json format bellow to right field names:  <br />
